This project requires you to familiarize yourself with several key concepts:

- Web server
- Server
- Web stack debugging
- Application servers

In the context of this project, your web infrastructure already uses Nginx, installed during an earlier web stack project, to deliver web pages. Although web servers can serve dynamic content, this function is typically delegated to an application server. Your task is to integrate an application server into your infrastructure, connect it with your Nginx, and configure it to serve your Airbnb clone project.

An application server is essentially a software framework or container designed to provide a runtime environment for web applications. It serves as a bridge between the web server and the web application, executing the application code and managing resources like concurrency, session management, and security.

For Python web applications, Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) is a notable example of an application server. It operates as a WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) HTTP server, facilitating communication between the web server and your application. Utilizing Gunicorn offers multiple benefits over direct module execution, including:

- Enhanced concurrency: Gunicorn efficiently manages multiple concurrent requests with a pre-fork worker model, creating several worker processes to handle requests simultaneously. This setup boosts your application's performance and ability to handle high traffic.
- Load balancing: By running multiple worker processes, Gunicorn distributes incoming requests evenly, preventing any single worker from being overloaded. This scalability allows your application to manage increased traffic effectively.
- Worker process management: Gunicorn oversees worker processes, initiating and terminating them as necessary. It ensures application stability by restarting workers that crash or become unresponsive.
- Seamless integration with web servers: Gunicorn can be effortlessly integrated with web servers like Nginx, which can then perform as a reverse proxy, handling tasks such as serving static files, caching, and SSL termination.
- Detailed logging and monitoring: Gunicorn logs requests, worker status, and errors, providing valuable data for debugging and monitoring your application.
- Customizable configuration: Gunicorn offers extensive configuration options to tailor its operation to your application's requirements, including adjustments to worker process numbers, timeouts, and logging settings.
